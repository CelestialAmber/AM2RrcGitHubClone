SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- DirectX9.0 or newer installed.

Unzip the contents of the archive in a folder and run the exe.


KEYS
To configure the game keys and joypad buttons, go to the options screen. 
You can change any game options, including the controls, during gameplay.
XBox 360 Gamepads are detected automatically.

F11 - Show FPS
F12 - Capture Screenshot
ESC - Options Menu
Alt+Enter - Toggle Fullscreen
Alt+F4 - Exit Game

FAQ
- Where are my screenshots? I can't find them anymore!
Look in your AppData/Local folder, it's usually in this location:
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R

- Why are my screenshots so big?
The screenshots are now taken with the size of the displayed window.
If you want the classic 320x240 screenshots, set the display to Windowed 1x
before pressing F12.

- Can I use my old saves?
No. The game changed a lot since the demo, along with the save format.

- I have an Arcade cabinet, can I exit AM2R with just 1 key?
Sure! After running the game once, go to this folder:
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R
And edit config.ini, setting the following values:
EnableExitButton=1 (should be 0 by default)
KeyboardButtonExit, JoystickButtonExit and XBJoypadButtonExit can be used to
customize which button / key is used to exit. Default is ESC for keyboard,
Back for XInput, and button 10 for DirectInput.
